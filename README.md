This repository holds an updated example for Atlassian's [ react-beautiful-dnd tutorial ](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)
using modern react syntax, modern libraries, and custom hooks. This example also uses vite and typescript, as 
opposed to vanilla javascript.
